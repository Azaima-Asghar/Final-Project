# Final-Project

## QuickDBD
The ERD of the database shows physical diagrams portraying the physical relationship, or how the data is connected, between each table. The two initial datasets (Modeling Probability of Mortgage Default and Performance Data) portray a one-to-one relationship which means that a row, or entity, is only referenced in one other table. In this case the entity is the Loan_Identifier column. 

For our next steps we will be adding more datasets to our database,  to create multiple relationships between them. 

Using pgadmin we will create the relationship schema of the datasets, which are imported as tables. The server on pgadmin will be hosted on AWS. The database will be shared publicly with flask. The flask app will be coded using VS Code.
